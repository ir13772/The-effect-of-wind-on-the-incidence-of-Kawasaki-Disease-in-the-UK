# This is a script you can easily use to collect weather variables from Wunderground.com, including maximumm, minimum and averages of several weather variables of interest.I used this method for a data analysis project for my MSc degree on Kawasaki Disease to study historical weather variables in the UK (from 2014) and analyse if their was an association with these variables and diseases initiation.

# If you would like to achieve something similar using Wunderground, you can look up each sample on Wunderground, i.e. 24 December 2014 (any location), copy and past from the website into Excel spreadsheets, and download them as csv files. You can run this code using pandas on Spyder, as I did, to read each csv file and collect your variable of interest.
