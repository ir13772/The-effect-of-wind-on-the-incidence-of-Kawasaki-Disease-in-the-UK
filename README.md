# This is a script you can easily use to collect weather variables from Wunderground.com, including maximumm, minimum and averages of several weather variables.
#
# I used this method for a data analysis project for my MSc degree in medicine on Kawasaki Disease to study historical weather variables in the UK (from 2014) and analyse if their is an association with these variables and diseases initiation. 
#
# If you would like to achieve something similar using Wunderground, you can each sample, i.e. 24 December 2014 (any location), and copy and past from the website into csv files.
#
# You can run this code using pandas on Spyder, as I did, to gather the variables of interet!
